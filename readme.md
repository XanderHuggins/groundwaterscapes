# Groundwaterscapes code repository

This is the code repository associated with the manuscript: Huggins et al. (in revision @ Water Resources Research). Groundwaterscapes: A global classification and mapping of groundwaterâ€™s large-scale socioeconomic, ecological, and Earth system functions.  Preprint available at: https://doi.org/10.31223/X5M382

This repository contains all scripts necessary to preprocess input data and re-run the groundwaterscape derivation methodology. Some scripts were executed on clusters provided by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada, so this workflow is not set-up to be run entirely on one's local computer. On this basis, this repository is best understood as a "workbook" that demonstrates all steps undertaken to generate study outcomes.

**Workbook script folder structure**: <br/>
- `on.R`: calls the here() function and source runs scripts in `\0-steup` and `\00-functions` folders.
- `\0-steup`: loads CRAN packages, sets certain package options, sets custom plotting themes
- `\00-functions`: contains custom, simple functions with explanatory names
- `\scripts\1-preprocessing`:
  - contains preprocessing scripts to harmonize data to 5 arcminute resolution, found in subfolder `\01-spatial-harmonizattion `.
  -  creates a raster stack of harmonized input data, normalizes data, and checks for collinearity
- `\scripts\2-analysis\a1-function-combinations`: matrix plots and maps of individual system functions
- `\scripts\2-analysis\a2-SOM-clustering`:
  - contains all self-organizing map scripts and other associated classification procedures.
  -  `s01-01-som1-iterations-syntheticspace.R` is written to be run on a remote cluster using `SOM-iter-array-syntheticspace.sl`
  -  `s02-01-som1-iterations-funnspace.R` is written to be run on a remote cluster using `SOM-iter-array-fullspace.sl`
- `\scripts\2-analysis\a3-landscape-metrics`: landscape metric analysis of groundwaterscapes
- `\scripts\2-analysis\a4-performance`: grid cell residual from groundwaterscape
- [datasources.md](https://github.com/XanderHuggins/gcs-archetypes/blob/master/datasources.md) : documentation and web-links to all data used in this study.

Additional scripts, such as plotting scripts, can be made available upon request.
